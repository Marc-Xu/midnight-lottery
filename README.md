# CRUD Template 🍽️

**CRUD-Template** is a template FastAPI application that features a layered architecture (Router → Service → Repository → ORM → Database), custom error handling, and full test coverage.

## Features

- Environment-based configuration via `.env`
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM with typed models
- Repository layer with generic and specialized methods
- Service layer enforcing business rules
- Clean API routing using FastAPI routers
- Custom exceptions and global handlers
- CI pipelines for linting and testing on PRs to `main`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### Running the App
